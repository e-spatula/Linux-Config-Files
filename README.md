# My Linux Config Files

Because I am prone to mistyping commands on the commandline and accidentally delete files I preferred to keep I am making this repo to store my ZSH profile. 

I imagine in the future I will probably store other linux config files here, but for the moment I am content to simply keep this here. 

As an additional protection against accidental deletion (and so that I don't have a git repo in my home directory) I created a hard link between this file and my actual ```.zshrc``` file in my home directory.
